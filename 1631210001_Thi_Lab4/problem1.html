        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adpiscing elit. Phasellus aliquan Dr. Anthony Fauci won’t show up in person in the Senate after all. The top pandemic doctor decided not to bend the rules by showing up in person for a Senate hearing set for Tuesday
        on the government’s response to the pandemic. He changed his mind after initially vowing to appear in person despite being exposed to a top White House staffer who has tested positive for the virus. “Fauci ... will appear by videoconference,”
        along with other officials, CNN reported. Fauci, who says he is observing a previously unknown “modified quarantine" regimen, has said he would wear a face mask and observe social distancing requirements when he answers questions from senators.
